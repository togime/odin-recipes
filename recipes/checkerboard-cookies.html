        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>
            Checkered cookies are decorative cookies, usually 
            made around Christmas, combining a vanilla and 
            chocolate flavor.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>200g dairy butter</li>
            <li>250g wheat flour</li>
            <li>100g icing sugar</li>
            <li>2ts vanilla sugar</li>
            <li>2ts cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place room temperature butter, flour and icing 
                sugar in a food processor and process the 
                mixture until you get a nice, cohesive dough.
            </li>

            <li>
                Divide the dough in two. Knead one dough with 
                vanilla sugar, and the other with cocoa powder.
            </li>

            <li>
                Divide the cocoa and vanilla dough into two 
                pieces each. Roll out four long sausages.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place a vanilla and a cocoa sausage next to each 
                other. Place the opposite on top of these to 
                create a checkerboard pattern. Press the sausages 
                together lightly and shape the sides straight by 
                pressing each side lightly against the kitchen 
                counter.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place plastic wrap around the dough and press the 
                edges lightly to make a square. Place in the 
                freezer for 15 minutes, or in the refrigerator for 
                30 minutes. This will make it easier to cut.
            </li>

            <li> Cut into slices about 1-2 cm thick. Bake the 
                squares at 175 dgrees until they are golden and 
                nicely browned, about 12 minutes. Let them cool.
            </li>

            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
