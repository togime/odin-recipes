        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by pounding the steak with a meat mallet.</li>

            <li>
                Season with sliced garlic, salt, and bay leaves, 
                then set aside.
            </li>

            <li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into very thin sticks.</li>

            <li>Wash the potatoes until the water runs clear.</li>

            <li>
                Drain the potatoes as best you can and fry them in 
                hot oil until golden brown.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place the potatoes in absorbent paper, season with 
                salt, and set aside.
            </li>

            <li>Meanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a frying pan.</li>

            <li>
                Add the butter and bay leaves and fry the steak on 
                both sides over low heat.
            </li>

            <li>
                When the meat is almost cooked, add the mustard, 
                beef stock, and white wine.
            </li>

            <li>Combine all ingredients and let the sauce reduce.</li>

            <li>
                Transfer the meat to a plate and pour the sauce 
                over it.
            </li>

            <li>
                Fry an egg in a little olive oil and place it on 
                top of the meat.
            </li>

            <li>
                Arrange the potatoes around the steak and add a 
                slice of lemon.
            </li>

            <li>Enjoy!</li>
