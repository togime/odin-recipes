        <ul>
            <li>4 pieces of cod</li>
            <li>1 Portuguese cabbage</li>
            <li>1kg potatoes</li>

            <li>400ml olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by cutting the cabbage leaves in half 
                and rinsing them in water.
            </li>

            <li>
                In a saucepan, bring the water, 2 bay leaves, 
                cod, and cabbage to a boil. Season with salt.
            </li>

            <li>
                After boiling, let it cook for about 15 to 20 
                minutes, or until the cabbage is cooked and the 
                cod is flaking.
            </li>

            <li>
                Wash the potatoes well and cook them in salted 
                water for 30 minutes, or until cooked through. 
                Remove from the heat and peel them. Set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                In a frying pan, place the olive oil, the 2 bay 
                leaves, and the peeled and crushed garlic cloves. 
                Cook for 4 minutes. Discard the garlic and bay 
                leaves.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place the cod fillets in a serving dish, arrange 
                the cabbage around them, and finally add the 
                boiled potatoes. Drizzle with the flavored olive 
                oil and serve.
            </li>
