**This is a project from The Odin Project's Foundations Course curriculum.**

>It serves the purpose of practicing the HTML knowledge I've adquired so far into the course.

### After completing the task: 
- I have gotten more confortable writing the barebones structure of an HTML page, as well as, to practice making links, adding images, and making both ordered and unordered list.
- I practiced Git on the command line and tried commiting more often and to write better commit messages, but I'm still a bit lost regarding the best times to make a commit and how to structure my messages in a concise way.
