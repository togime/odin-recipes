**This is a project from The Odin Project's Foundations Course curriculum.**

## Part 1: HTML
>It serves the purpose of practicing the HTML knowledge I've adquired so far into the course.

### After completing the task: 
- I have gotten more confortable writing the barebones structure of an HTML page, as well as, to practice making links, adding images, and making both ordered and unordered list.

- I practiced Git on the command line and tried commiting more often and to write better commit messages, but I'm still a bit lost regarding the best times to make a commit and how to structure my messages in a concise way. 

## Part 2: CSS
>It serves the purpose of practicing the CSS knowledge I've adquired so far into the course.

### After completing the task:
- I have gotten a feel for how dastrically the html files can change according to what you want to add or do with their content.

- For the most part I got to experiment a lot with colors, but also had a lot of fun figuring out how to manipulate lists and images to look different ways and adding checkboxes.

- In the end I gained a better understanding of CSS selectors and how to use them to avoid repetion, how to use the **device** property to structure different elements and got better at searching for answers when met with a wall.
